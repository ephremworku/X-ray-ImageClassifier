# Xray-Image Binary Classifier

Welcome to the Xray-Image Binary Classifier repository! This project implements a binary classification model for X-ray images, using a dataset found on Kaggle: [Fracture Multi-region X-ray Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bmadushanirodrigo/fracture-multi-region-x-ray-data).

## Overview

The goal of this project is to accurately classify X-ray images into two categories: presence or absence of fractures. The model was trained to achieve a high accuracy, and the results are promising.

## Contents

- **Notebook:** The Jupyter Notebook (`Xray_Image_Binary_Classifier.ipynb`) contains the complete implementation of the model, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Data:** While the data itself is not included in this repository due to size constraints, it can be easily accessed and downloaded from the Kaggle link provided above.
- **Model:** The trained model is saved and can be loaded for inference or further training.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/xray-image-binary-classifier.git
   cd xray-image-binary-classifier
1. **Download the dataset::**
   
   gGo to the Kaggle dataset page and download the data. Extract the files into the repository directory.
